What are branches?  

How do you set up a simple branch?  

How do you set up nested branches?  


Example:  
```c++
    if (3 == 3) {
        std::cout << "3 is equal to itself" << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "3 is not equal to itself" << std::endl;
    }
    if (age >= 10 ){
        if (age >= 18) {
            std::cout << "You're an adult, in the U.S." << std::endl;
        }
        else {
            std::cout << "You're an adolescent" << std::endl;
        }
    }
    else if (age >= 1) {
        std::cout << "You are a child right now" << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "You are not yet born" << std::endl;
    }
```
