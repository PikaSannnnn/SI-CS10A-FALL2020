## Notes 
* Each week.md file will contain everything that was covered within that session in addition to extra, harder practice problems
* Each week.md will be updated on Tuesday/Thursday after the second session for that set (MT = set 1, WR = set 2)
* Answers to each week's problems will be given the Thursday of the next week (starting after Week 5)

## Guidelines 
* Predict the output questions are those with only a simple `block of code`
* Given `blocks of code` for coding problems are starting code
* If a question asks specifically what is being asked, **ignore** the above two guidelines
