## Notes 
* Each week.md file will contain everything that was covered within that session in addition to extra, harder practice problems
* Each week.md will be updated on Tuesday/Thursday after the second session for that set (MT = set 1, WR = set 2)
* Answers to each week's problems will be given the Thursday of the next week (starting after Week 5)

## Guidelines 
* Predict the output questions are those with only a simple `block of code`
* Given `blocks of code` for coding problems are starting code
* If a question asks specifically what is being asked, **ignore** the above two guidelines

## Practice Problems Guideline
* **Basic** - Simple problems similar to what you see in the Zybooks pages and may see in exams
* **Moderate** - Problems that require a little more thinking. These may feel around the difficulty of challenge activities
* **Difficult** - Problems that are generally classified as Hard. These most resemble lab difficulty
* **Creative** - Problems that focus on thinking out of the box. These can vary in difficulty as the focus isn't the hardness, but rather the use of what you've learned
* **Challenging** - Problems that I generally wouldn't give during a 1 hour SI session, but are good practice. These generally require you to use and understand every aspect of the chapter
* **EXTRA** - These problems are usually slightly harder and longer than **Challenging**. They are also mostly blank slate, with barely any instructions that will walk you through the problem.
