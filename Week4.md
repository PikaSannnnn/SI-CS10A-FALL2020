### Group String Manipulation Activity
---
```c++
// TASK: Name Collection
/* You will code with your groups 
  Include all appropriate libraries

  Ask the user for their full name.
  If the first letters of their first and last name is not capitalized, capitalize it.
  If any other names are uppercase, change them to lower case.
  If there are any symbols other than a hyphen (-) or numbers, remove them from the name.
  Output the person's full name. If the person's last name is more than 7 characters, print out the abbreviation.
  On the next line, output the total letters in the name
  If the name *Kris Miller* is entered, output "Hello Professor Kris Miller!"

  Example Output (Jason jalepeno): 
  Jason J.
  Number of letters: 13
